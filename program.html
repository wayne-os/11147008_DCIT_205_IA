        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>We offer Undergraduate programs in;</b><br><u>1.Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Single-Major):</u></b> This is a four-year program that provides students with a strong foundation in the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. Students will learn about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, artificial intelligence, and other topics.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><u>2.Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Major-Minor):</u> This is also a four-year program that allows students to combine a major in computer science with a minor in another subject. This option is a good choice for students who are interested in a particular area of computer science, such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, or computer graphics.</p>
        <br>
        <p><u>3.Bachelor of Science in Information Technology:</u> This is a four-year program that focuses on the application of computer science to business and other fields. Students will learn about computer systems, networking, database management, web development, and other topics.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>We also offer Postgraduate programs such as;</b><br><u>1.Master of Science in Computer Science:</u> This is a two-year program that provides students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of computer science. Students can choose from a number of specializations, including artificial intelligence, software engineering, computer graphics, and computer networks.</p>
        <br>
        <p><u>2.Master of Philosophy in Computer Science:</u> This is a two-year program that allows students to conduct research in a specific area of computer science. Students will work closely with a faculty advisor to develop a research project and write a thesis.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><u>3.Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science:</u> This is a four-year program that allows students to conduct original research and make significant contributions to the field of computer science. Students will work closely with a faculty advisor to develop a research project and write a dissertation.</p>
